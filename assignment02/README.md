# Java Backend Bootcamp Assignment 2

I have to get the string from the user(console) and then I have to print the numbers of characters of the string with the character in order.

**I provide the different approaches to solve this problem. So You will see the solution with HashMap and HashSet with List structure.**

You can see the example below:

| Entered String | Desired output  1  | Desired output  2 |
|----------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Recep Tayyip   | r1e2c1p2t1a1y2i1   | recptayi          |
| John Doe       | j1o2h1n1d1e1       | johnde            |

You can see the steps below for how you can compile my code on your machine.
