# Java Backend Bootcamp Assignment 4

I try to implement the relationship between cars using Inheritance In this 
repository. 

**I provide the two types of Vehicle, one of them is Gasoline Car the other 
one is Electrical Car, and these cars inherited from Vehicle because vehicle 
is the main Class for creating any type of car. 


You can see the Hierarchy below:
```
Vehicle
│   
│      
│
└───Electrical Vehicle
│   │ 
│   │
│   └───Tesla
│       │   Model One
│       │   Model Two
│   
└───Gassoline Car
│   │ 
│   │
│   └───Clio
│       │   Clio 1
│       │   Clio 2

```
